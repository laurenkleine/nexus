#Stenglein Lab Standard Taxonomic Assessment Pipeline

[>>>Full Documentation<<<](https://laurenkleine.github.io/shpinx-nf-doc-taxonomy/)

The Stenglein Lab Standard Taxonomic Assessment Pipeline taxonomically assigns reads in a NGS dataset that remain after filtering host sequences.

This pipeline uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a bioinformatics domain specific language for workflow building. Software dependencies are handled using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) â€“ a container technology which offers excellent accessibility and reproducibility.
