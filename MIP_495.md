  * Added 'stenglein lab scripts" dependencies into /bin folder in taxonomy-nf

#### 01-29-2018
  * Met with Chris, went over project --decieded to go write main.nf on server (don't need Docker yet)
  * Created main.nf- processes: RunPreFastQC & RunCutAdapt
  
#### 01-30-2018
  * Met with Mark, went over Nextflow 
    * Look into: how to display error messages throughout pipeline
    * clean up slideshow to present in lab meeting (02/06)
  * Created process: RunPostFastQC
  
#### 02-01-2018
  * Created process: Fastq_a (this process does fastq -> fasta, & concats paires fastas)
- [ ] rename accrodingly

#### 02-03-2018
  * Created process: reconcile_reads
- [x] "run_preprocessing_pipeline_one_sample" complete
- [x] go back and clean up this code --read documentation to remove long absolute paths 
- [x] create "preprocessing" subdirectory --send RunPreFastQC, RunCutAdapt, RunPostFastQC, Fastq_a, cd_hit_est, reconcile_reads process results into this subdirectory

  
#### 03-06-2018 

* TODO (03-20-2018 - and 03-27-2018)

- [x] nextflow.config
- [x] begin Docker integration

- [ ] continue creating Dockerfiles, building images, and configuring to pipeline (test on computer that has no dependencies installed)


#### 03-20-2018 
* TODO (03-27-2018 and beyond)
- [ ] Discuss with Mark how/where to put summaries of the results in a convenient location/format
- [ ] write code for error messages - i.e. if parameters aren't entered correctly
- [ ] clean up pipeline - shorter variable names/channel names
- [ ] create process at begining of pipeline that determines if the fastq format has ' 1' or '/1' syntax in sequence ID line    and corrects the formatting issue if necessary
- [ ] start writing documentation (on website and md)
- [ ] Website Content: Project Summary, Software Requirements, Installation Tutorial, Usage, Example Analysis and Output, References, Contact
